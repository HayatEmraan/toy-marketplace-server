      "question": "What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?",
      "answer": "Access tokens and refresh tokens are used in authentication systems. An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources on behalf of an authenticated user. It is typically a string that is included in API requests to verify the user's authorization. Access tokens have a limited lifespan and need to be periodically renewed or refreshed.\n\nA refresh token is a longer-lived credential that is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate. When an access token expires, the refresh token can be used to request a new access token from the authentication server.\n\nBoth the access token and refresh token should be securely stored on the client-side. The access token is often stored in memory or a local storage mechanism provided by the client platform, such as a browser's session storage or cookies. The refresh token, being a long-lived credential, needs to be stored in a more secure manner, such as an HTTP-only cookie or a secure storage mechanism provided by the client platform."
